The typetools/jdk11u repository
===============================

This is a merge of `openjdk/jdk11u` and `typetools/jdk`.\
That is, it is a fork of `openjdk/jdk11u`, with Checker Framework type annotations.


Do not edit this repository
---------------------------

You should NOT edit this repository directly.

Make edits in the `typetools/jdk` repository, then pull them into this
repository (or one of its branches) with
```
git pull https://github.com/typetools/jdk.git <branchname>
```
When merging pull requests from `typetools/jdk`, create a merge commit
(do not squash or rebase).


Why is this repository needed?
------------------------------

The `typetools/jdk` repository that contains annotations does not compile,
because the commit of `openjdk/jdk` on which it is based no longer
compiles, due to changes to tools such as compilers.  The `jdk11u`
repository has been updated and does compile, but it has diverged from the
main `typetools/jdk` repository on which later versions of the JDK (12+)
are based.


Original README follows
-----------------------

The remainder of this file is the README file of `typetools/jdk`.


Typetools fork of the JDK
=========================

This fork of the JDK contains type annotations for pluggable type-checking.

This fork is not up to date with respect to `openjdk/jdk` (the current OpenJDK version).
This fork contains all commits through the release of JDK 11:
https://github.com/typetools/jdk/commit/8a780d3273fe6f38ca392d63e89e3e8e552ac767

After you make changes to this repository, you will need to pull the
changes into `typetools/jdk11u`, and that may be necessary even to make
pull requests succeed.

The remainder of this file is the README from `openjdk/jdk`.
