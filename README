Typetools fork of the JDK
=========================

This fork of the JDK contains type annotations for pluggable type-checking.

This fork is not up to date with respect to `openjdk/jdk` (the current OpenJDK version).
This fork contains all commits through the release of JDK 11:
https://github.com/typetools/jdk/commit/8a780d3273fe6f38ca392d63e89e3e8e552ac767

After you make changes to this repository, you will need to pull the
changes into `typetools/jdk11u`, and that may be necessary even to make
pull requests succeed.

The remainder of this file is the README from `openjdk/jdk`.
