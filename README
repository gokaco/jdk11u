Typetools fork of the JDK
=========================

This fork of the JDK contains type annotations for pluggable type-checking.

This fork is not up to date with respect to `openjdk/jdk` (the current OpenJDK version).
This fork contains all commits through the release of JDK 11:
https://github.com/typetools/jdk/commit/8a780d3273fe6f38ca392d63e89e3e8e552ac767

This fork is an ancestor of JDK release forks such as jdk11u.  This fork
does not compile, because the commit of `openjdk/jdk` on which it is based
no longer compiles, due to changes to tools such as compilers.
Repositories such as jdk11u and jdk12u have been updated and do compile.

This fork's annotations are pulled into those repositories, in order to
build an annotated JDK.  We do not write annotations in (say) jdk11u,
because it has diverged so far from other repositories that merging it into
jdk12u would be more painful than merging jdk into both jdk11u and jdk12u.


Pull request merge conflicts
----------------------------

Suppose that a pull request, from branch `MYBRANCH` of `ORG`'s fork of
`jdk`, is failing with a merge conflict in `jdk11u`.  Do the following in
the master branch of `ORG`'s fork of `jdk11u` (create the fork if it does
not exist):

 * `BRANCHNAME=<MYBRANCH>`
 * `git pull --ff-only https://github.com/typetools/jdk11u.git`
 * `git checkout -b $BRANCHNAME`
 * `git pull https://github.com/ORG/jdk.git $BRANCHNAME`
 * Resolve conflicts
 * `git push --set-upstream origin $BRANCHNAME`
 * `git checkout master`
 * Rerun CI for the pull request

After the pull request is merged to https://github.com/typetools/jdk,
follow the instructions at https://github.com/typetools/jdk11u to update
jdk11u, taking guidance from branch MYBRANCH of ORG/jdk11u to resolve conflicts.
Then, discard branch MYBRANCH of ORG/jdk11u.
